# 5-Minute Teaser Demo Script

**Purpose**: Lightning-fast intro to hook interest  
**Duration**: 5 minutes max  
**Best for**: Trade shows, cold outreach, initial discovery calls, elevator pitch situations  
**Goal**: Create "aha moment" and schedule longer demo

---

## Pre-Demo Setup (1 minute before)

### Environment
- [ ] Demo account with ONE pre-built wheel (impressive, full year of activities)
- [ ] Browser clean, zoom 100%
- [ ] Sidebar CLOSED initially for maximum visual impact
- [ ] Know their industry/role (if possible)

### Mental Preparation
**Key insight**: You have 5 minutes to make them say "Show me more." Focus on ONE killer feature: **visual annual planning with drag-and-drop editing.**

---

## MINUTE 1: The Problem Hook

### Open with Pain Point

**Say:**
> "Quick question: How do you currently plan your year?"

*Listen to 10-second answer. Common responses:*
- "Excel spreadsheets"
- "Google Calendar"
- "Notion/Asana"
- "We don't really..."

### Acknowledge the Pain

**For spreadsheets:**
> "Right, so you've got rows and columns, but you can't actually SEE the year flow, can you?"

**For calendars:**
> "Okay, so day-by-day view. Ever try to see your entire year at once?"

**For project tools:**
> "Makes sense. But when your boss asks 'What's our Q2 look like?' can you answer in 10 seconds?"

**For "we don't":**
> "You're not alone. Most teams piece it together from memory and scattered notes."

---

## MINUTE 2: The "Aha" Moment

### Reveal the Wheel

**Screen share the pre-built wheel. Let them see it for 3 seconds in silence.**

**Then say:**
> "This is YearWheel. Your entire year. One screen."

**Slowly rotate the wheel 360 degrees:**
> "All 12 months, all your projects, campaigns, events - whatever you're planning - in a circular calendar."

### Quick Visual Tour (30 seconds)

**Point while describing:**
- **Months**: "Inner ring: January through December"
- **Rings/Bands**: "Each band is a category - marketing, sales, operations, whatever"
- **Colored segments**: "Each colored arc is a project or event"
- **Length of arc**: "Length shows duration - short events are small, year-long initiatives wrap around"

**Key line:**
> "You can see your entire year's strategy at a glance. No scrolling. No hunting through tabs."

---

## MINUTE 3: The Killer Feature

### Set Up the Scenario

**Say:**
> "But here's where it gets really good. Plans change constantly, right? Someone says 'Move that launch to Q3 instead of Q2.'"

**Point to an activity in Q2:**
> "Let's say this product launch needs to move..."

### Execute the Drag

**Click and drag the activity from Q2 to Q3 (slowly and deliberately):**

*Wait 2 seconds in silence after you drop it. Let the visual sink in.*

**Then say:**
> "That's it. Dates updated. No forms. No spreadsheet formulas. Just drag it."

### Show the Power

**Click sidebar to show activity details:**
> "Start date, end date - all recalculated automatically."

**Hover over edge of activity until cursor changes to ↔:**
> "Need it to run longer? Drag the edge."

**Drag the edge to extend/shrink:**
> "Done. That fast."

**Key insight to share:**
> "What takes 5 minutes in Excel takes 5 SECONDS in YearWheel. And everyone on your team sees the change immediately."

---

## MINUTE 4: The Use Cases

### Make It Personal

**Ask:**
> "What would you use this for? [pause for answer]"

*If they engage, build on their answer. If not, offer examples:*

**For business leaders:**
> "Most teams use it for annual planning - all departments' initiatives in one place. Marketing sees what Sales is doing, Product knows when launches happen."

**For project managers:**
> "Perfect for multi-project visibility. See all your projects, spot resource conflicts, adjust timelines with a drag."

**For HR/Operations:**
> "Great for recurring events - quarterly reviews, monthly all-hands, training cycles. Plot it once, see the pattern."

**For consultants/agencies:**
> "Clients love it - show them their full campaign calendar in one visual. Way more impressive than a spreadsheet."

### Show Presentation Mode (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "And when you present this to executives or clients..."

**Click to hide 1-2 rings using checkboxes:**
> "Hide details they don't need to see..."

**Click Export:**
> "Export as PNG, PDF, or SVG..."

**Say:**
> "Into your deck in 2 clicks. Professional visual that actually communicates the plan."

## MINUTE 5: Close for Next Step

### The Qualification Question

**Ask:**
> "Could you see your team using something like this?"

*Listen to their response:*

### Response A: "Yes, definitely!" (High Interest)

**Immediate action:**
> "Perfect. Let me send you a free trial link right now - you can build your first wheel in 15 minutes. And let's schedule 15 minutes next week so I can show you the collaboration features and answer any questions. Does [day/time] work?"

**If they say yes to meeting:**
- Get their email
- Confirm meeting time
- Send trial link and Quick Start guide immediately after call

### Response B: "Maybe, tell me more..." (Medium Interest)

**Ask:**
> "What would make this a 'definitely yes' for you?"

*Listen to their objections/questions:*
- **Price**: "Free tier gives you 2 wheels and 3 team members. Most people start there."
- **Features**: "What specific feature do you need? [Listen, then address]"
- **Timing**: "When would be a better time? Can I check back then?"
- **Need to see more**: "Makes sense. Can I show you a 15-minute full demo? [Suggest time]"

### Response C: "Not really..." (Low Interest)

**Quick qualify-out:**
> "No worries. Can I ask - what are you using now that's working well?"

*Listen. If they truly don't have a planning pain point:*

**Say:**
> "Makes sense. Keep us in mind if your planning process gets painful. Here's my email if you ever want to revisit. Best of luck!"

**Move on. Don't oversell.**

## The 30-Second Elevator Version

If you only have 30 seconds (literally in an elevator, trade show aisle, etc.):

**Say:**
> "YearWheel is a visual annual planning tool. Your entire year in one circular calendar - like a clock but for the whole year. You can drag and drop to reschedule projects, and it updates dates automatically. Makes annual planning visual instead of buried in spreadsheets. Want to see it? [Show wheel on phone/laptop]"

**Hand them a card/link:**
> "Try it free at yearwheel.com. Takes 5 minutes to build your first wheel."

## Success Metrics

### A Successful 5-Minute Demo:
✅ They lean forward during the drag-and-drop  
✅ They ask "Can I try that?"  
✅ They mention a specific use case for their team  
✅ They agree to longer demo OR trial signup  
✅ They ask about pricing/team features  

### Signs to Cut It Short:
🚩 They're clearly distracted/multitasking  
🚩 They say "We already have [tool] that works"  
🚩 They keep saying "We don't really plan ahead"  
🚩 They ask for features way outside YearWheel's scope  

**If you see red flags**: Politely offer to send info, then end the demo. Don't waste their time or yours.

## Script Variations

### For Virtual Trade Shows / Webinars
- Pre-load wheel, minimize clicking
- Emphasize visual impact (since everyone sees screen clearly)
- Use chat to drop links
- Keep it to 3 minutes if multiple demos in queue

### For In-Person Trade Shows
- Use tablet/large screen for visual impact
- Let THEM drag something (physical touch is powerful)
- Have QR code ready for trial signup
- Collect business cards, not just emails

### For Cold Outreach Calls
- Ask permission first: "Do you have 5 minutes for me to show you something visual?"
- If no screenshare possible, describe it vividly
- Focus on pain point heavily
- Goal is to schedule a proper demo, not close on call

### For Warm Referrals
- Mention who referred you: "[Name] thought you'd find this useful for [use case]"
- Skip some of the qualifying questions (they're pre-qualified)
- Can go slightly longer (7-8 minutes) if they're engaged

## Pro Tips

**Silence is powerful**: After you drag an activity, PAUSE. Let them process the visual. Don't fill the silence immediately.

**One feature only**: Resist urge to show everything. The 5-minute demo is ONLY about "visual planning + drag-and-drop". Save collaboration, AI, integrations for the longer demo.

**Watch their eyes**: If they lean in, slow down and let them absorb. If they look confused, ask "Does this make sense so far?"

**End early if you've hooked them**: If they say "This is exactly what we need!" at minute 3, STOP the demo. Say "Want to see more right now or should I schedule a full walkthrough?" Don't risk over-demoing.

**Mobile tip**: If demoing on a phone/tablet, use landscape mode for wheel visibility. Zoom controls work better on touch screens.

## What NOT to Do

❌ Don't show multiple wheels (overwhelming)  
❌ Don't dive into pricing details (saves for later)  
❌ Don't demonstrate every feature (focus on ONE killer feature)  
❌ Don't let them derail with "What about [edge case]?" questions (defer to longer demo)  
❌ Don't talk for 5 straight minutes (ask questions, engage them)  
❌ Don't apologize for "rushing through" (confidence is key)
