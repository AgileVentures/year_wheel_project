## Tips for Success

### Engagement Techniques
- **Ask questions**: "What does your current planning look like?"
- **Real-time customization**: Rename rings to their departments
- **Pain point focus**: Show features that solve their specific problems
- **Invite participation**: "Want to try dragging this activity?"

### Pacing
- **First 5 min**: Hook (show most impressive feature)
- **Next 10-15 min**: Core workflow (create → edit → export)
- **Next 10 min**: Advanced features relevant to them
- **Last 5 min**: Q&A and next steps

### Red Flags (When to Cut Short)
- Client is multitasking/distracted → Schedule another time
- They keep asking about features you don't have → Qualify better
- They're not the decision maker → Get the decision maker on call
