# 15-Minute Quick Demo Script

**Purpose**: Show core YearWheel value in a tight timeframe  
**Duration**: 12-15 minutes + 3-5 min Q&A  
**Best for**: Initial discovery calls, busy decision makers, time-constrained demos  
**Goal**: Get them excited enough to book a longer session or start trial

---

## Pre-Demo Setup (2 minutes before call)

### Prepare Demo Environment
- [ ] Open YearWheel in clean browser window (no other tabs visible)
- [ ] Use demo account with ONE pre-built wheel (marketing/HR based on lead)
- [ ] Zoom set to 100% (full year view) - use Zoom tab to select "Full year"
- [ ] Left sidebar open to Disc view (they need to see the structure)
- [ ] Have blank wheel ready in another tab (for quick creation demo)

### Know Your Audience
- What industry? (Marketing, HR, Education, Project Management)
- Current pain point? (Spreadsheets, Gantt charts, no visualization)
- Team size? (Determines collaboration emphasis)

---

## MINUTE 1-2: Hook with Visual Impact

### Open Pre-Built Wheel
**Screen**: Full wheel with all activities visible, zoomed to 100%

**Say (while they take it in):**
> "This is a complete annual plan for a marketing department - the entire year at a glance. Every colored segment is a campaign, project, or event. Notice how you can instantly see what's happening each month, what overlaps, and where the busy periods are."

**Optional - Rotate wheel slowly (in Zoom tab, click "Start Rotation" if you want to show this):**
> "Unlike a spreadsheet where you scroll endlessly, or a Gantt chart that's hard to update, YearWheel shows the whole year in a single view. Let me show you how quick it is to build this."

### Why This Works
✅ Immediate visual impact (not another boring SaaS form)  
✅ Shows end result first (they understand the value)  
✅ Creates curiosity ("How do I build this?")

---

## MINUTE 3-5: Create Wheel from Scratch (Speed Run)

### Switch to Blank Wheel Tab

**Say:**
> "Let me show you how fast you can set this up. I'll create a simple plan in about 2 minutes."

### Step 1: Create Rings (30 seconds)
**Sidebar should be open on Disc tab → Find Inner Rings section**

**Note**: New wheels start with one default ring called "Ring 1"

**Rename and add rings quickly:**
1. Click directly on "Ring 1" text → type "Marketing" → press Enter
2. Click "+ Add Ring" button
3. Click the new ring name → type "Sales" → press Enter
4. Click "+ Add Ring" again
5. Click the new ring name → type "Product" → press Enter

**Say while doing this:**
> "Rings are your main categories - departments, projects, or responsibility areas. You just click on the name to edit it. Most teams have 3-6 rings total."

### Step 2: Create Activity Groups (30 seconds)
**Scroll down to Activity Groups section → Click "+ Add Activity Group"**

**Create 4 groups quickly:**
1. Name: "Q1", pick blue color, click Add
2. Click "+ Add Activity Group" again
3. Name: "Q2", pick green color, click Add
4. Repeat for "Q3" (orange) and "Q4" (red)

**Say while creating:**
> "Activity groups determine the color of your activities. I'm setting up quarterly colors here - Q1 is blue, Q2 green, and so on. You could also color-code by status, priority, or project type - whatever makes sense for you."

**Important**: Don't confuse this with quarter zoom - these are just color categories that HAPPEN to be named after quarters.

### Step 3: Add 2-3 Activities (60 seconds)
**Click "+ Add Item" → Fill form quickly:**

**Activity 1:**
- Name: "Spring Product Launch"
- Ring: Marketing
- Group: Q1 (Blue)
- Dates: Jan 15 - Mar 31

**Activity 2:**
- Name: "Summer Campaign"
- Ring: Marketing  
- Group: Q2 (Green)
- Dates: Jun 1 - Aug 31

**Say while filling the form:**
> "Now we add activities. Each one needs a name, which ring it belongs to, what color group, and start/end dates. Watch the wheel as I add these."

**Point to wheel as activities appear:**
> "See? They appear immediately as colored arcs. The length shows duration, the position shows timing, the color comes from the activity group."

### Why This Works
✅ Proves it's not complicated  
✅ Shows speed (removes "too time-consuming" objection)  
✅ They see the building blocks clearly

---

## MINUTE 6-8: The "Wow" Moment - Drag & Drop

### Demonstrate Editing Power

**Say:**
> "Here's where it gets really powerful. Say your boss asks in a meeting: 'Can we move the product launch to May?' Watch this..."

**Drag "Spring Product Launch" from Q1 area to May:**
- Hover over the activity (shows tooltip with name)
- Click and hold in the **middle** of the activity (not the edges)
- Drag to May section of the wheel
- Release

**Pause for effect, then:**
> "Done. No forms, no menus. Just drag it. The dates update automatically in the sidebar data."

**Show resize:**
> "Or if the campaign needs to be longer..."

**Drag right edge of activity to extend it:**
- Hover slowly over the **right edge** of the activity
- Wait for cursor to change to resize arrows (↔)
- Click and drag to the right
- Release

> "Just stretch it. That simple. The end date updates automatically."

**Show ring change:**
> "Or if ownership shifts from Marketing to Sales..."

**Drag activity from Marketing ring to Sales ring:**
> "Just move it to the other ring."

### Have Them React
**Pause and ask:**
> "When was the last time updating your annual plan was that easy?"

### Why This Works
✅ Tangible "magic moment" that differentiates from competitors  
✅ Solves clear pain point (updating plans is tedious)  
✅ Interactive = memorable

---

## MINUTE 9-11: Presentation Mode (Second Wow)

### Set Up Scenario

**Say:**
> "Now imagine you're presenting this plan to different audiences. The board doesn't need to see every operational detail. Your team needs to see everything. Watch this..."

### Hide Rings for Board View
**In the sidebar, find the checkboxes next to each ring name:**

**Uncheck 2 rings:**
1. Click the checkbox next to "Product" ring → ring disappears from wheel
2. Click the checkbox next to "Sales" ring → ring disappears from wheel

**Point to wheel:**
> "Now we're only showing Marketing - perfect for the marketing budget meeting. The data isn't deleted, just hidden from view."

### Show All for Team View
**Check the rings again:**
1. Click checkboxes to check Product and Sales again
2. Rings reappear instantly

> "And with one click, everything's back for the team meeting."

**Say:**
> "Same plan, different views. No need to maintain multiple versions or create different PowerPoints."

### Why This Works
✅ Solves real presentation pain point  
✅ Shows flexibility without complexity  
✅ Appeals to managers/directors (common demo audience)

---

## MINUTE 12-13: Export for Impact

### Show Export Options

**Click "Export" button → Show formats:**
> "When you need this outside YearWheel - for PowerPoint, reports, or printing - just export."

**Explain quickly:**
- **PNG**: For presentations and emails (most common)
- **PDF**: For printing on large format (A1/A0)
- **SVG**: For design teams to customize
- **JPG**: For smallest file size

**Export as PNG:**
> "What you see is what you get. Takes 2 seconds."

**Show downloaded file:**
> "And now you have a professional visual for your board deck."

### Why This Works
✅ Removes "locked in platform" concern  
✅ Shows professional output  
✅ Demonstrates real-world use

---

## MINUTE 14-15: Close with Collaboration & Next Steps

### Quick Collaboration Mention

**Say:**
> "One last thing - this is collaborative. You can invite your team, everyone can edit in real-time, and you see who's working on what. Perfect for cross-functional planning."

**Show team icon/share button (don't go deep):**
> "I won't go deep on this now, but in a longer demo I can show you the full collaboration features."

### Transition to Q&A

**Ask:**
> "Before we wrap - what type of planning would this replace for you? Spreadsheets? Project management tool? Something else?"

**Listen for pain points, then:**
> "Great. Let me answer any questions, and I can show you [specific feature] if that's relevant."

---

## Q&A - Common Questions & Answers

### "How much does it cost?"
**Answer:**
> "YearWheel starts free - you can create 2 wheels and have up to 3 team members. If you need more wheels or unlimited team members, Premium is [price] per month. Most teams start free and upgrade as they grow."

**Then:**
> "Would you like to start with a free trial today? I can send you the link right after this call."

### "Can we import from [Excel/Google Sheets/Asana]?"
**Answer:**
> "You can export data from [tool] and manually input into YearWheel, which based on what we just saw takes about 10-15 minutes for a full year. We're working on direct imports for our Premium tier."

**If they push:**
> "Would this be a blocker? If you have a file, I can help you map it out in a follow-up session."

### "What if we need more complex dependencies/Gantt features?"
**Answer:**
> "YearWheel is designed for high-level annual planning and visualization - not task-level project management. Think of it as complementary to tools like Asana or Monday. You use YearWheel for strategic planning and those tools for day-to-day execution."

**Qualify:**
> "Is your main need strategic annual planning, or detailed task management?"

### "Can we customize colors/branding?"
**Answer:**
> "Yes - every activity group has customizable colors, and when you export, you can adjust in design tools if needed. We're adding brand theme support to Premium soon."

### "Does it work on mobile?"
**Answer:**
> "YearWheel works on tablets (iPad works great). Mobile phones are view-only currently - we find most planning happens on desktop. Is mobile editing critical for your team?"

### "How secure is our data?"
**Answer:**
> "All data is encrypted in transit and at rest, hosted on Supabase (built on AWS). We're SOC 2 Type II compliant [if true], and you can export your data anytime. Want me to send you our security overview?"

## Closing & Next Steps

### Option A: They're Ready (Ideal)
**Say:**
> "Great! I'll send you a trial link right now. You'll get access immediately. I'll also include links to our getting started guide. Want to schedule a 30-minute follow-up next week to answer any questions as you build your first wheel?"

**Then:**
> "Perfect. I'll send a calendar invite. In the meantime, feel free to email me with any questions - I typically respond within a few hours."

### Option B: They Need to Think
**Say:**
> "No problem. Let me send you the trial link and some resources. No commitment - just explore on your own time. Can I follow up with you next week to see if you have questions?"

**If they agree:**
> "Great. I'll send you a calendar invite for a quick 15-minute check-in. If you don't need it, just decline - no hard feelings!"

### Option C: Not the Right Fit (Qualify Out)
**Say:**
> "Based on what you've shared, it sounds like YearWheel might not be the perfect fit for your needs right now. [Competitor/alternative] might be better suited for [their requirement]. But if your needs change, feel free to reach out!"

**Why this works:**
✅ Respects their time  
✅ Builds trust (not pushy)  
✅ Keeps door open
