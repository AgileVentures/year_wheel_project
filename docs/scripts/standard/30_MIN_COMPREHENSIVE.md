## MINUTE 1-3: Context & Agenda

### Opening

**Say:**
> "Thanks for taking 30 minutes today. Based on our last conversation, you mentioned [pain point] with [current tool]. I'm going to show you how YearWheel solves that, and we'll have time for questions throughout."

### Set Agenda

**Say:**
> "Here's what we'll cover:"
> 1. "Quick overview of a completed wheel (2 min)"
> 2. "How to build one from scratch (5 min)"
> 3. "The editing features that make updates painless (5 min)"
> 4. "Presentation and export capabilities (5 min)"
> 5. "Team collaboration (5 min)"
> 6. "Your questions and next steps (rest of time)"
>
> "Feel free to interrupt with questions anytime."

---

## MINUTE 4-6: Show the End Result

### Open Pre-Built Wheel (Their Industry)

**Screen**: Full wheel with activities for their industry

**Say:**
> "This is what a complete annual plan looks like in YearWheel - let's say for a [marketing/HR/project] team. The entire year at a glance."

### Walk Through Visual Elements

**Point out while describing:**
- **Months**: "The inner ring shows all 12 months"
- **Rings**: "Each band is a different [department/project/category]"
- **Activities**: "Each colored segment is an [event/campaign/project]"
- **Colors**: "Colors show [quarters/types/priority]"

**Rotate slowly:**
> "Unlike spreadsheets or traditional Gantt charts, you see the full year flow. Notice how you can instantly spot busy periods, overlaps, and gaps."

### Ask Engagement Question

**Say:**
> "When you look at this, what jumps out at you? What would be in your rings?"

*Listen to their answer - this tells you what to emphasize later.*

---

## MINUTE 7-12: Build from Scratch (Interactive)

### Switch to Blank Wheel

**Say:**
> "That's the end result. Now let me show you how fast you can build this. I'll walk through it, but feel free to tell me what to add - treat this like your wheel."

### Create Rings (2 minutes)

**Ask:**
> "What are your main [departments/projects/categories] you'd want to track?"

*Use their answers to name rings. If they don't engage:*

**Say:**
> "Let's say we have Marketing, Sales, Product, and Operations. I'll create these..."

**Create 4 rings, naming as you go:**
- Sidebar should be open on Disc tab → Inner Rings section
- New wheels start with "Ring 1" - click directly on the name to edit
- Type new name, press Enter
- Click "+ Add Ring" to add more
- Point out they appear on wheel immediately as you add them

### Create Activity Groups (2 minutes)

**Explain:**
> "Activity groups are how you color-code. You can organize by quarter, by type, by priority - whatever makes sense for you."

**Ask:**
> "How would you want to color-code your activities?"

**Create 4 groups (use their suggestion or default to quarters):**
- Q1 (Blue)
- Q2 (Green)
- Q3 (Orange)
- Q4 (Red)

**Say while creating:**
> "As I add these, they become available in the activity form. Watch..."

### Add Activities (3 minutes)

**Ask:**
> "What's a major project or event in your [Q1/first quarter]?"

*Use their answer, or suggest:*

**Create first activity together:**
- Name: [Their suggestion or "Spring Product Launch"]
- Ring: Marketing
- Group: Q1
- Start: January 15
- End: March 31

**Point to wheel:**
> "And there it is. Blue arc in the Marketing ring, spanning Jan-Mar."

**Add 2-3 more activities quickly:**
- Get their input if engaged, or create logical examples
- Vary the rings and groups
- Show different lengths (1 month vs full year)

**Say:**
> "In practice, you'd add all your major initiatives. Takes about 15-30 minutes for a full year, depending on detail."

---

## MINUTE 13-17: The "Wow" Features (Editing)

### Drag & Drop Demo

**Set up scenario:**
> "Okay, here's where it gets powerful. Imagine you're in a planning meeting. Someone says 'Actually, we need to move the product launch to May because of budget approval delays.'"

**Show traditional way (sarcastically):**
> "In Excel, you'd open the file, find the row, change the dates, hope you didn't break formulas..."

**Show YearWheel way:**
> "In YearWheel? Watch..."

**Drag activity from Q1 to May:**
- Pause for visual impact
- Click sidebar to show dates updated

**Say:**
> "Done. Dates updated automatically. That's it."

### Resize Demo

**Say:**
> "Or if the campaign needs to run longer..."

**Drag right edge to extend:**
- Hover slowly over the **right edge** of activity until cursor changes to ↔
- Click and drag to extend
- Release

> "Just stretch it. New end date saved automatically."

### Ring Transfer Demo

**Say:**
> "Or if responsibility shifts - say Product team takes over from Marketing..."

**Drag between rings:**
- Click and hold in middle of activity
- Drag **radially** inward or outward to a different ring
- Release

> "Move it to the other ring. Still shows all the same dates and info, just in a new category."

### Let Them Try (If Screenshare Allows)

**Say:**
> "Want to try? I can give you control and you can drag something."

*If yes: Give control, coach them through it.*  
*If no: "No worries, I'll keep going."*

---

## MINUTE 18-22: Presentation & Export

### Presentation Mode

**Set up scenario:**
> "Now, you've built this plan. Time to present it. But different audiences need different views. The board doesn't need operational details. Your team needs everything."

### Show Hiding Rings

**In sidebar, find the checkboxes next to ring names:**

**Uncheck 2-3 rings:**
- Click checkbox next to "Product" → disappears
- Click checkbox next to "Operations" → disappears

> "Board meeting? Show only strategic rings like Marketing and Sales."

**Check them back:**
- Click checkboxes again → rings reappear

> "Team meeting? Show everything."

**Say:**
> "Same plan, tailored views. No multiple versions, no separate PowerPoints. One source of truth."

### Export Capabilities

**Click Export button:**
> "When you need this outside YearWheel - in a deck, printed on the wall, or in a report..."

**Show formats:**
- **PNG**: "For PowerPoint, most common"
- **PDF**: "For printing large format (A1/A0) or formal reports"
- **SVG**: "For design teams to customize further"
- **JPG**: "Smallest file size for quick sharing"

**Export PNG:**
> "Takes 2 seconds, you get exactly what you see on screen."

**Open downloaded file:**
> "Professional visual, ready to paste anywhere."

### Zoom Features

**Navigate to Zoom tab in sidebar:**
> "During presentations, you can zoom into specific periods using these controls..."

**Show quarter zoom buttons:**
**Click Q2 button:**
> "Board wants Q2 details? Click Q2. Now April-June fills the screen."

**Show month dropdown:**
**Click dropdown, select a month:**
> "Or drill into a single month - select March, and you see just that month."

**Show Full Year:**
**Select "Full year" from dropdown:**
> "And 'Full year' brings you back to overview."

**Note**: There's also a "Fit" button below the wheel visualization that centers everything.

## MINUTE 23-27: Collaboration Features

### Team Setup

**Say:**
> "Most planning isn't solo. YearWheel is built for teams. Let me show you the collaboration features."

### Show Team Sharing

**Click Share button:**
> "You can share a wheel with your team. Everyone gets edit access, can work simultaneously."

**Point out real-time features:**
- **Presence indicators**: "See who's online"
- **Auto-sync**: "Changes appear immediately for everyone"
- **Conflict prevention**: "No overwriting each other's work"

### Team Management

**Navigate to Teams (if time allows):**

**Show team invitation:**
> "Send invite, they get email, click to join. That simple."

### Public Sharing

**Toggle public sharing:**
> "For external stakeholders - clients, board members, partners - you can create a read-only public link."

**Show share link:**
> "They can view without logging in, but can't edit. You control access - toggle off anytime."

---

## MINUTE 28-30: Advanced Features Preview

### Quick Mentions (Don't Deep Dive)

**Multi-Year Planning:**
> "You can add multiple year pages - perfect for 3-5 year strategic plans or keeping historical data."

**Version History:**
> "Every change is saved as a version. Made a mistake? Restore to any previous point."

**Templates:**
> "We have pre-built templates for common use cases - HR planning, marketing calendars, school years. Customize and go."

### Premium Callout

**Say:**
> "One premium feature I want to mention - our AI Assistant. You describe what you want to plan in natural language, and it creates the activities for you. Saves hours on initial setup."

**Show quickly (if available):**
> "For example: 'Create a 12-month content marketing plan with weekly blog posts, monthly newsletters, and quarterly campaigns.'"

**Say:**
> "And it generates all the activities, properly dated and categorized. Premium feature, but incredibly powerful for teams managing complex plans."

---

## MINUTE 31-35: Q&A & Objection Handling

### Transition to Questions

**Say:**
> "That's the full tour. You've seen how to build, edit, present, and collaborate. What questions do you have?"

### Common Questions & Answers

#### "How much does it cost?"
**Answer:**
> "YearWheel has a free tier - 2 wheels, up to 3 team members. Most individuals and small teams start there. For larger teams or organizations, Premium is [price] per user per month or [price] per user per year. Premium includes unlimited wheels, unlimited team members, AI assistant, priority support, and advanced integrations."

**Then:**
> "Based on your team size of [X], here's what I'd recommend... [suggest appropriate plan]"

#### "Can we import from [existing tool]?"
**Answer:**
> "You can export your data from [tool] as CSV/Excel and manually input into YearWheel - typically takes 15-30 minutes for a full year. We're working on direct integrations for Premium users, starting with Google Calendar and Sheets."

**Qualify:**
> "How much existing data are we talking? If it's a lot, I can help you with a mapping session to make it faster."

#### "What about mobile?"
**Answer:**
> "YearWheel works great on tablets (iPad, etc). Mobile phones are currently view-only - we find most planning happens on desktop/laptop. Is mobile editing critical for your team?"

*If yes:* "It's on our roadmap. When do you need it by?"  
*If no:* "Great, then you're all set."

#### "How does it compare to [competitor]?"
**Answer for Gantt tools (MS Project, Asana timeline):**
> "YearWheel is focused on high-level annual planning and visualization - the strategic view. Gantt tools are better for task-level project management with dependencies. Many customers use both - YearWheel for strategy, [tool] for execution."

**Answer for spreadsheets:**
> "Spreadsheets are flexible but not visual. YearWheel gives you the visual overview while still being easy to update. Plus real-time collaboration without version control nightmares."

**Answer for Notion/Trello:**
> "Those are great for flexible workflows and documentation. YearWheel is purpose-built for annual planning - the circular calendar view is something you can't replicate in list/board views. Some customers use both."

#### "Is our data secure?"
**Answer:**
> "All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest. We're hosted on Supabase/AWS infrastructure with enterprise-grade security. You can export your data anytime in JSON format. We're [SOC 2/ISO certified - if true]. Want me to send our security whitepaper?"

#### "Can we customize branding?"
**Answer:**
> "You can customize activity colors, and when you export you can edit in design tools if needed. We're adding custom brand themes to Premium soon - ability to set default colors, fonts, and add your logo."

#### "What if we need [feature X] you don't have?"
**Answer:**
> "Great question. Can you tell me more about that use case? [Listen, understand]"

*If reasonable feature:* "That's on our roadmap for [timeframe if known]. I can add you to the beta list."  
*If niche request:* "Interesting. We'd need to see demand from more customers before prioritizing that. Is it a dealbreaker?"  
*If out of scope:* "That's beyond what YearWheel is designed for. I'd recommend [alternative tool] for that need."

## MINUTE 36-40: Close & Next Steps

### Qualify Interest Level

**Ask:**
> "Based on what you've seen, how do you feel about YearWheel for [your use case]?"

*Listen to their response. They'll fall into one of these categories:*

### Response A: High Interest ("This looks great!")

**Say:**
> "Fantastic! Here's what I recommend: Start with a free trial today, and I'll schedule a 30-minute implementation session next week to help you build your first real wheel. Sound good?"

**Then:**
> "I'll send you the trial link right after this call. In the meantime, here are a couple things to think about:"
> 1. "What's the first wheel you want to build? [project/annual plan/etc]"
> 2. "Who on your team should have access?"
> 3. "Do you have existing data to import or starting fresh?"

**Schedule follow-up:**
> "Let's find time next week to work through your first wheel together. Does [day/time] work?"

### Response B: Medium Interest ("Interesting, need to think about it")

**Ask qualifying questions:**
> "What would you need to see or know to feel confident moving forward?"

*Listen to objections:*
- **Price**: Show ROI (time saved, better decisions)
- **Feature gap**: Check if dealbreaker or nice-to-have
- **Need approval**: "Who else needs to see this? Can we schedule a team demo?"
- **Timing**: "When would be better? Can I check in then?"

**If legitimate hesitation:**
> "No problem. Let me send you a trial link and some resources. Try building a wheel on your own time - no commitment. Can I follow up next week to answer any questions?"

### Response C: Low Interest ("Not sure this is for us")

**Probe gently:**
> "Can I ask what's giving you pause?"

*Listen to real objection:*
- **Wrong tool for need**: "That's fair. YearWheel might not be the best fit for [their need]. Have you looked at [alternative]?"
- **No budget**: "Understood. Keep us in mind when budget opens up. You can use the free tier indefinitely for up to 2 wheels."
- **No clear pain point**: "Got it. If your planning process becomes painful in the future, we're here."

**Qualify out gracefully:**
> "Thanks for your time today. If your needs change, feel free to reach out. Best of luck with [their project]!"
