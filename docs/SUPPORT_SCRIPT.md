**📸 Screenshot: Editor with all main areas marked (wheel visualization, side panel, header)**

### Point out key areas (give a "tour"):

**1. Center Area - The Wheel Visualization:**
> "This is the year wheel itself - your circular annual calendar. Each month is a section, and the year rotates clockwise from January at the top."

**2. Left Sidebar - The Organization Panel:**
> "This is your control panel. Here you create and edit all content. Notice the three tabs at the top:"
- 🎯 **Disc** - *"Shows rings and activities hierarchically, just as they appear on the wheel"*
- 📋 **List** - *"Table view for quick editing of many activities"*
- 📅 **Calendar** - *"Traditional month view if you prefer that"*

**3. Top Header - The Toolbar:**
> "Here you'll find all main functions:"
- **Save button** - *"Saves your changes (but autosave works too!)"*
- **Export** - *"Download as image or PDF for presentations"*
- **Version History** - *"Restore to previous versions if something goes wrong"*
- **Share button** - *"Invite team members or create a public link"*

### Important context:
> "The editor may seem complex at first, but every feature is there for a reason. Over the next 10 minutes we'll focus on the basics: creating rings, adding activities, and navigating the wheel. Once you're comfortable with that, you can explore the advanced features."

### Success indicators:
✅ User can identify the three views (Disc/List/Calendar)  
✅ User sees the wheel rotating with month names  
✅ User understands that left panel = input, center = visualization

- **Ensure you're on**: **Disc** tab in left sidebar
- **Locate**: Any ring in the "Outer Rings" or "Inner Rings" section
- **Find**: Checkbox (☑️) to the left of each ring name

### Guide user to:
1. **Click**: Checkbox next to a ring to uncheck it
2. **Watch the wheel**: Ring disappears immediately from the visualization
3. **Click**: Checkbox again to check it
4. **Watch the wheel**: Ring reappears

**📸 Screenshot: Before/after comparison - wheel with all rings visible vs some hidden**

### Explain pedagogically with examples:
> "This is one of our most popular features - especially for managers and project leaders presenting to different audiences."
>
> **Practical example:**
> "Say you're an HR manager with a year wheel containing 6 rings: Recruitment, Onboarding, Training, Retention, Administration, and Budget. When presenting to the board, you might only want to show Recruitment, Training, and Budget - hiding the operational details. Then when you meet with the HR team, you show all 6 rings."
>
> "The great thing is that no data disappears - you're just controlling what's displayed. You can toggle back and forth during a presentation depending on what questions are asked!"

### Why this is powerful:
- **Tailored presentations** without needing multiple copies of the same wheel
- **Focus attention** on what's relevant right now
- **Avoid information overload** for the audience
- **Change quickly** during meetings when discussion shifts focus

### Success indicators:
✅ User can hide and show rings with the checkbox  
✅ User sees the change in real-time on the wheel  
✅ User understands that data isn't deleted, just hidden

## 5. RENAME DEFAULT RINGS

**📸 Screenshot: Outer Rings section with pencil icon highlighted on a ring**

### Navigate to:
- **Ensure**: Left sidebar is open (click hamburger menu ☰ if closed)
- **Ensure**: "Disc" tab (🎯) is selected
- **Scroll to**: "Outer Rings" section in sidebar

### Guide user to:
1. **Find**: First ring (e.g., "Ring 1")
2. **Click**: Pencil icon (✏️) next to ring name
3. **Type**: New name, e.g., "Marketing"
4. **Press**: Enter or click the checkmark (✓)
5. **Observe**: Name updates in both the list and on the wheel

### Repeat for 2-3 rings to create context:
- "Marketing"
- "Sales"
- "Product Development"

**📸 Screenshot: Wheel with renamed rings visible on the visualization**

### Explain with analogy:
> "Rings are the main categories in your year wheel - think of them like tabs in a folder or departments in a company."
>
> **Outer rings** (these we just renamed) are the big categories - perhaps departments, projects, or responsibility areas. They're on the outer edge of the wheel and most prominent.
>
> **Why is this important?** When you add activities later, you must link them to a ring. So the 'Marketing' ring will contain all marketing activities, 'Sales' all sales activities, etc. It creates structure!"

### Tips to share:
💡 "Choose ring names based on how your organization is structured. Are you functional (Marketing, HR, IT)? Or project-based (Project A, Project B)? Or perhaps thematic (Innovation, Stability, Growth)?"

### Success indicators:
✅ User can rename at least 2 rings  
✅ User sees ring names update on the wheel  
✅ User understands that rings = organizational categories

### Create 2-3 more for variety:
- "Q2 Projects" (green)
- "Recurring" (gray)
- "Milestones" (red)

**📸 Screenshot: Multiple activity groups listed with their colors**

### Explain the difference between Rings and Activity Groups:

> **Rings = WHERE** the activity belongs (department/category)  
> **Activity Groups = HOW** the activity is color-coded (type/theme)
>
> **Practical example:**
> - Ring: "Marketing" (where)
> - Activity Group: "Q1 Campaign" (how - gives blue color)
> - Result: A blue activity in the Marketing ring
>
> "This dual system gives you flexibility: You can have marketing activities in all quarterly groups, and see them color-coded by quarter. Or have recurring activities (gray) spread across all departments."

### Why colors are important:
- **Quick recognition** - "All blue = Q1" makes it easy to see the quarter's activities
- **Visual grouping** - Similar activities get the same color even in different rings
- **Presentation power** - Colors make the wheel easy to understand for new viewers

### Success indicators:
✅ User can create at least 2 activity groups with different colors  
✅ User understands the difference between rings (position) and groups (color)

> 1. **WHERE** it belongs (which ring)
> 2. **WHEN** it happens (start to end)
> 3. **WHAT** type it is (color from activity group)
>
> "As you add more activities, you build up a complete picture of your year. Overlapping activities? No problem - YearWheel automatically stacks them so everything is visible!"

## 9. DRAG AND DROP ACTIVITIES (Interactive Editing)

**📸 Screenshot: Mouse pointer hovering over activity, with "move" cursor**

### Explain the concept first:
> "One of the most powerful features in YearWheel is that you can drag activities directly on the wheel - just like moving post-it notes on a board. No forms, no menus - just drag and drop!"

### Demonstrate moving an activity:
1. **Hover**: Slowly over the "Spring Product Launch" activity
2. **Observe together**: 
   - Cursor changes to a hand or move arrow
   - Activity gets a lighter/darker shade (highlighting)
   - A tooltip may show the activity name
3. **Click and hold**: On the middle of the activity
4. **Drag gently**: To the April-May period (later in the year)
5. **Release**: Mouse
6. **Look at left panel**: Dates have updated automatically!

**📸 Screenshot: Activity being dragged with ghost/preview visible under mouse**

### Demonstrate moving between rings:
1. **Click and hold**: On "Spring Product Launch" again
2. **Drag radially**: Inward or outward to another ring (e.g., from "Marketing" to "Sales")
3. **Release**: In the new ring
4. **Explain**: "Now the activity belongs to a different ring - perfect when responsibility shifts between departments!"

**📸 Screenshot: Activity being dragged between two rings**

### Demonstrate resizing:
1. **Hover**: Very slowly over the left edge of an activity
2. **Wait**: Until cursor changes to double arrows (↔)
3. **Explain**: "This means you can change the activity's start or end date"
4. **Click and drag**: Left edge to the left (move start earlier)
5. **Release**: Activity is now longer
6. **Try right edge**: Drag right edge to the right (extend end)

**📸 Screenshot: Resize cursor (double arrows) at activity edge**

### Explain why this is powerful:
> "Imagine this scenario: You're in a meeting with your manager. She says 'Can't we move the product launch to May instead?' Previously, you'd need to open forms, find the activity, change dates, save. Now? Just drag the activity to May. Done in 2 seconds!"
>
> "Or say a project got delayed. Instead of deleting and recreating, just drag the activity forward in time. Same if something needs to be extended - just drag the edge longer."

### Important tips to share:
💡 **Remember**:
- **Middle of activity** = Move entire activity (keeps same length)
- **Edges** = Change start or end date (changes length)
- **Between rings** = Changes which ring the activity belongs to
- **Around wheel** = Changes dates (keeps same ring)

### Common questions:
**Q: What if I accidentally drop in the wrong place?**  
A: Press Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Cmd+Z (Mac) to undo! YearWheel has undo/redo for all changes.

**Q: Can I drag multiple activities at once?**  
A: Currently one at a time, but you can quickly drag them one after another.

### Success indicators:
✅ User can move an activity to another month  
✅ User can move an activity to another ring  
✅ User can resize an activity  
✅ User sees dates update automatically in sidebar  
✅ User understands difference between move (middle) and resize (edge)

> - Fit to quickly get overview
>
> **For presentations:**
> - Zoom in on a month to discuss it in detail
> - Rotate to dynamically show the whole year
> - Zoom out for big-picture discussions

### Practical scenario:
> "Imagine you're presenting Q2 plans. You start with overview (50% zoom), talk about year-long goals. Then you zoom into April-June (150%), discuss specific campaigns. Finally you zoom even more on a single activity (200%) and talk about it in detail. All without changing slides!"

### Success indicators:
✅ User can zoom in and out with both buttons and slider  
✅ User can start and stop rotation  
✅ User can use "Fit" to center the wheel

**Scenario 2: Quarterly check-ins**
> "CFO wants to see Q2 plans. You click the 'Q2' button - boom, April-June is displayed with all campaigns, projects and milestones clearly visible. Next quarter? Click Q3. No hassle."

**Scenario 3: Annual planning**
> "When planning the entire year, you need overview. Keep the dropdown on 'Full year' and zoom out to 75%. When discussing specific periods, quickly zoom in with Q-buttons or month selection."

### Combination with other zoom tools:
**Demonstrate:**
1. **Select**: "Q1" (quarter zoom)
2. **Then**: Use plus button (+) to zoom even more
3. **Then**: Drag the wheel (pan) to see different parts of Q1
4. **Explain**: "You can combine smart focus with manual zoom for perfect control!"

### Tips for power users:
💡 **Quick navigation:**

   - **When**: Need to edit design later or scale up a lot

3. **PDF**
   - **Use**: Printing, formal documents, archiving
   - **Advantage**: Professional standard, maintains quality when printing
   - **File size**: Medium-large
   - **When**: Will print on large plotter or include in formal report

4. **JPG**
   - **Use**: Email (smaller files), quick sharing
   - **Advantage**: Smallest file size
   - **Disadvantage**: Loses some quality, no transparency
   - **When**: File size is more important than perfect quality

### Demonstrate PNG export:

1. **Select**: PNG (default)
2. **Observe**: Preview of current view
3. **Tip**: "What you see on screen is what you get - so adjust zoom and rotation first!"
4. **Click**: **"Export PNG"** button
5. **Wait**: 2-3 seconds for rendering
6. **Observe**: File downloads (usually to Downloads folder)
7. **Open**: File to show result

**📸 Screenshot: Downloaded PNG file open in image viewer**

### Important preparations before export:

> "Before exporting, think about what you want to show:"

**Step-by-step preparation:**
1. **Hide unnecessary rings**: Uncheck boxes for rings you don't want to show
2. **Adjust zoom**: 
   - Full year overview? Zoom to 75-100%
   - Focus on a quarter? Use Q-buttons + zoom to 150%
3. **Center**: Click "Fit" for perfect centering
4. **Rotate (optional)**: Adjust so important month is at top
5. **NOW export**: What you see = what you get

### Practical use cases:

**Scenario 1: Board presentation**
> "You're presenting the annual plan to the board. Hide detailed operational rings, keep only strategic rings. Export as PDF for professional feel. Insert into PowerPoint or bring printed on A3 paper."

**Scenario 2: Team wall planning**
> "Team wants the wheel on the wall. Zoom to 100%, show all rings, export as PDF or PNG. Send to local print shop and ask for A1 or A0 size. Now you have physical planning on the wall!"

**Scenario 3: Quick email update**
> "Boss asks 'What does Q3 look like?'. Click Q3, zoom to 150%, export as JPG (smaller file), attach in email. Answer in 30 seconds!"

**Scenario 4: Design customization**
> "Marketing wants to match the wheel with company's visual identity. Export as SVG, open in Illustrator, adjust colors and fonts, use in annual report."

### Tips for best results:
💡 **Higher quality:**
- Zoom to 100-150% for sharper text
- Make sure no activities are too small to read
- Export PNG or PDF (not JPG) for presentation quality

💡 **Smaller file size:**
- Export JPG instead of PNG
- Hide unnecessary rings before export (fewer elements = smaller file)

### Common questions:
**Q: Can I change the size of the image?**  
A: Yes! The image is high resolution (like 2000x2000 pixels). You can scale down in PowerPoint/Word without quality loss.

**Q: Why does the export look different from screen?**  
A: Export takes a "snapshot" of exactly what's displayed. Check zoom, hidden rings, and rotation before export.

**Q: Can I export only a section of the wheel?**  
A: Zoom to desired section before export - the wheel exports exactly as you see it!

### Success indicators:
✅ User can export in all 4 formats  
✅ User understands when each format is appropriate  
✅ User can prepare the wheel (zoom/hide) before export  
✅ User can find downloaded file and open it  
✅ User understands that export = snapshot of current view

## 13. SAVE YOUR WORK (Automatic & Manual)

**📸 Screenshot: "Saving..." indicator in header**

### Point out the auto-save function:
- **Observe**: "Saving..." or "Saved" indicator in top header
- **When shown**: After EVERY change (add activity, rename ring, etc.)
- **Timing**: ~1-2 seconds after you stop typing/clicking

### Explain the safety:
> "One of the best features in YearWheel: You NEVER need to worry about losing your work. YearWheel auto-saves constantly in the background."
>
> **How it works:**
> 1. You make a change (e.g., rename a ring)
> 2. You see "Saving..." in the header
> 3. After ~2 seconds: "Saved ✓"
> 4. Your data is now safely in the cloud

**📸 Screenshot: "Saved ✓" indicator**

### Demonstrate:
1. **Make a small change**: Rename a ring
