# YearWheel Version History - Advanced User Guide

**Purpose**: Complete guide to version control, restoration, and collaboration tracking  
**Audience**: All users (free and premium), team leads, support team  
**Feature Status**: Available to all users

---

## Overview

YearWheel's Version History is a comprehensive versioning system that automatically tracks every change to your wheels, allowing you to:

- 📜 View complete history of changes
- ⏪ Restore previous versions
- 🔍 Compare versions side-by-side
- 👥 See who made what changes (team wheels)
- 💾 Create manual snapshots (save points)
- 🔄 Branch from historical versions

**Think of it as "Git for annual planning"** - but simpler and visual.

---

## How Versioning Works

### Automatic Version Creation

**📸 Screenshot: Version timeline showing auto-save points**

YearWheel automatically creates versions when:
- ✅ Any activity is added, edited, or deleted
- ✅ Rings are created, renamed, or removed
- ✅ Activity groups are modified
- ✅ Inner ring content changes
- ✅ Settings are updated (visibility, colors, etc.)

**Frequency:** Every ~30 seconds after a change (debounced to avoid version spam)

**Storage:** Last 50 versions for free users, unlimited for Premium

---

### Manual Snapshots

You can also create manual "save points":
- Before major restructuring
- Before team collaboration session
- After completing quarterly planning
- Before applying AI assistant suggestions

**📸 Screenshot: "Create Snapshot" button in header**

**How to create:**
1. **Click**: Version History icon in header (clock ⏱️ or history 📜 icon)
2. **Click**: **"Create Snapshot"** button
3. **Enter description**: "Before Q2 revisions" or "Final 2026 plan"
4. **Click**: **"Save Snapshot"**

Manual snapshots are:
- ⭐ Marked with star badge
- 📌 Pinned to top of version list
- 📝 Include your custom description
- 🔒 Never auto-deleted (even when hitting version limits)

- ✅ Can hover to see activity details
- ❌ Cannot edit (read-only)
- ❌ Cannot drag activities

## Restoring a Previous Version

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Restoring creates a NEW version based on the old one. Current state is not deleted!

**📸 Screenshot: Restore confirmation dialog**

### Restoration Process:

1. **Select version**: Click on version in timeline
2. **Review preview**: Make sure it's the right one
3. **Click**: **"Restore This Version"** button
4. **Confirmation dialog**: Warns that current state will be replaced
   - "Are you sure? Current version will be saved before restoring."
5. **Click**: **"Yes, Restore"**

**What happens:**
1. Current state is saved as a new version (safety backup)
2. Selected historical version's data is copied
3. New version created with restored data
4. You're back in editor with restored state
5. Success message: "Restored version from [date]"

**📸 Screenshot: Success message after restoration**

### After Restoration:

- Current version number increases (e.g., was v47, now v48)
- Version v48 contains data from old version (e.g., v32)
- Version v47 (pre-restoration) still exists in history
- You can "restore the restoration" if you change your mind

**💡 Pro tip:** Create manual snapshot before restoring, name it "Before restore v32"

## Comparing Versions

**📸 Screenshot: Version comparison view with side-by-side wheels**

### Side-by-Side Comparison

**How to compare:**
1. **In version history**: Click **"Compare Versions"** button
2. **Select two versions**: 
   - Version A (left side): Usually older version

3. **Click**: **"Compare"**

**Comparison view shows:**

**Left side (Version A):**
- Wheel visualization as it was

## Team Collaboration Features

### User Attribution

For team wheels, each version shows:
- 👤 User avatar and name
- 📧 Email (on hover)
- 🕐 Timestamp
- 📝 What they changed

**Example timeline:**
```
v47 - Sarah Johnson - 2 hours ago
      Added 3 activities to Q2 ring

v46 - John Smith - 3 hours ago
      Renamed "Marketing" to "Marketing & Sales"

v45 - You - 5 hours ago
      Created snapshot: "Q1 Final Plan"

v44 - AI Assistant - 5 hours ago
      Auto-generated 15 activities
```

### Presence Indicators

**📸 Screenshot: Real-time presence indicators on version timeline**

When multiple users are editing:
- 🟢 Green dot: Currently viewing/editing
- 🔵 Blue dot: Recently active (<5 minutes)
- ⚪ Gray: Offline

Shows who's looking at version history simultaneously!

## Auto-Save vs Manual Snapshots

### When to use each:

**Auto-Save (default):**
- ✅ Regular editing work
- ✅ Incremental changes
- ✅ "Just in case" protection
- ⏱️ Automatic, no action needed

**Manual Snapshots:**
- ⭐ Before major restructuring
- ⭐ Milestone completions ("Q1 Final", "Approved Plan")
- ⭐ Before risky operations (bulk delete, AI generation)
- ⭐ Versions you want to easily find later

**📸 Screenshot: Timeline mixing auto-saves and manual snapshots (stars)**

### Snapshot Management

**Features:**
- **Pin to top**: Keep important snapshots easily accessible
- **Custom descriptions**: "Board Presentation Version" vs generic "Version 34"
- **Export individually**: Download .yrw of specific snapshot
- **Share snapshot**: Generate link to view that specific version (read-only)

---

## Version Metadata

Each version stores:

**Core Data:**
- Complete wheel structure (rings, activities, groups, labels)
- Organization data (inner ring content)
- Settings (colors, visibility, orientations)

**Metadata:**
- Version number (sequential)
- Timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
- User ID and name
- Change description
- Is manual snapshot (boolean)
- Parent version ID (for branching)

**Not stored:**
- Zoom level and rotation (reset each time)
- User's personal UI preferences
- Temporary selection states

---

## Advanced: Branching & Merging

**Note:** Full branching/merging is a Premium feature (or future roadmap item)

**Current capability:**
- ✅ Restore old version → creates new branch implicitly
- ✅ Multiple team members can restore different versions
- ❌ Cannot merge divergent branches automatically

**Workaround for merging:**
1. Restore version A
2. Manually copy activities from version B
3. Create snapshot: "Merged A + B"

## Exporting Versions

**📸 Screenshot: Export options for specific version**

### Why export a version:

- 📦 Archive for compliance/records

### How to export:

1. **Select version** in history
2. **Click**: **"Export This Version"** button (download icon)
3. **Choose format**: .yrw (YearWheel native) or JSON
4. **File downloads**: `wheel-2026-v34.yrw`

### Re-importing:

1. **On Dashboard**: Click "Import Wheel"
2. **Select file**: Choose .yrw file
3. **New wheel created**: With data from that version
4. **Keep original**: Both versions now exist as separate wheels

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Version history is empty"

**Causes:**
- Very new wheel (no changes yet)
- Database sync issue
- Viewing while offline

**Solutions:**
- Make a change (add activity) to generate first version
- Refresh browser
- Check internet connection

---

### Issue: "Cannot restore version"

**Causes:**
- Permission denied (not owner/admin on team wheel)
- Version data corrupted (rare)
- Wheel is locked (admin lock feature)

**Solutions:**
- Check your role: Members can view but may not restore
- Contact team owner for permission
- Report to support if data corruption suspected

---

### Issue: "Restored wrong version"

**Solution:**
- **Immediate**: Press Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z (undo)
- **After closing**: Open version history, restore the pre-restoration version
- All versions are preserved, nothing is lost!

---

### Issue: "Versions not updating in real-time"

**Causes:**
- Realtime subscription disconnected
- Firewall blocking WebSocket
- Supabase realtime channel issue

**Solutions:**
- Refresh page (Cmd+R / Ctrl+R)
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Manual refresh: Click refresh icon in version history

---

## Best Practices

### Do's:

✅ **Create snapshots at milestones**: "Q1 Complete", "Board Approved", "Final 2026 Plan"  
✅ **Descriptive names**: "Before summer restructure" vs "Snapshot 1"  
✅ **Review changes before presenting**: Check version from last week to see what changed  
✅ **Export important versions**: Local backup of critical milestones  
✅ **Restore freely**: You can always restore the current version back

### Don'ts:

❌ **Don't rely on versions as only backup**: Also export .yrw files periodically  
❌ **Don't delete manual snapshots**: They're your save points  
❌ **Don't restore without preview**: Always review before clicking "Restore"  
❌ **Don't spam snapshots**: Create them at meaningful points (not every 5 minutes)
