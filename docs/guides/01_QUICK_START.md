# Quick Start Guide

**Estimated time**: 5 minutes  
**Goal**: Create your first year wheel and add activities

---

## Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Go to [yearwheel.com](https://yearwheel.com)
2. Click **"Get Started"**
3. Enter your email and password
4. Check your email for verification link (optional for immediate use)

---

## Step 2: Create Your First Wheel

1. Click **"Create New Wheel"** on your dashboard
2. Your wheel is created automatically with:
   - A month ring (Jan-Dec)
   - Default outer rings
   - The current year

---

## Step 3: Set Up Your Rings

**Rings** are the main categories in your wheel - like departments, projects, or focus areas. They appear as circular bands around the year wheel where you'll place activities.

1. Open the left sidebar (click ☰ if closed)
2. Find the **"Inner Rings"** section - your new wheel starts with one default ring called "Ring 1"
3. **Click directly on "Ring 1"** to edit the name
4. Type your first category (e.g., "Marketing") and press Enter
5. Click **"+ Add Ring"** to add more rings (aim for 3-5 total)
6. Name each ring for your main categories

**Example rings:**
- **For business planning**: Marketing, Sales, Product, Operations
- **For personal planning**: Personal, Family, Work, Health
- **For project phases**: Planning, Development, Launch, Review

**Note**: Inner rings are closer to the center. You can also add Outer rings which appear on the outside edge of the wheel.

## Step 4: Create Activity Groups

**Activity Groups** determine the color of your activities. Think of them as color-coding categories - all activities in the same group will have the same color on your wheel.

1. Scroll to **"Activity Groups"** section (below the rings)
2. Click **"+ Add Activity Group"**
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Campaigns")
4. Choose a color (e.g., blue)
5. Click **"Add"**
6. Repeat to create 3-4 more groups with different colors

**Example groups:**
- **By quarter**: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 (helps visualize quarterly planning)
- **By status**: Planned, In Progress, Completed
- **By priority**: High Priority, Medium Priority, Low Priority
- **By type**: Campaigns, Events, Recurring Tasks, Milestones

**Why colors matter**: When you have many activities on your wheel, colors help you instantly recognize patterns - like seeing all Q2 activities at a glance, or spotting all high-priority items.

## Step 5: Add Your First Activity

An **activity** is any event, project, campaign, or task you want to track during the year. It appears as a colored arc on your wheel.

1. Click **"+ Add Item"** at the top of the sidebar
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: "Spring Product Launch"
   - **Ring**: Select "Marketing" (this determines WHICH ring it appears in)
   - **Activity Group**: Select "Campaigns" (this determines the COLOR)
   - **Start Date**: Choose a date (e.g., January 15, 2026)
   - **End Date**: Choose a date (e.g., March 31, 2026)
   - **Description** (optional): Add details about this activity
3. Click **"Add Activity"**

Watch your activity appear on the wheel as a colored arc in the Marketing ring! 🎉

**What you'll see**: A colored segment (arc) that starts at January 15 and ends at March 31, positioned in the ring you selected, with the color from your activity group.

## Step 6: Add More Activities

Create 2-3 more activities to see how the wheel builds up. Each activity will stack on top of others in the same ring, creating a complete visual of your year.

**Activity 2:**
- Name: "Summer Campaign"
- Ring: Marketing
- Group: Q2 or "Campaigns" (can use same or different color)
- Dates: June 1 - August 31, 2026

**Activity 3:**
- Name: "Monthly Newsletter"  
- Ring: Marketing
- Group: Recurring (if you created this group)
- Dates: January 1 - December 31, 2026 (spans the full year)

**Tip**: If you have multiple rings (Marketing, Sales, Product), try adding activities to different rings to see how they appear as separate bands on the wheel.

## Step 7: Try Drag & Drop Editing

YearWheel's most powerful feature: you can move and resize activities directly on the wheel!

**Moving an activity:**
1. **Hover** over an activity on the wheel
2. **Click and hold** in the middle of the activity
3. **Drag** to a different month or time period
4. **Release** to drop

The start and end dates update automatically! ✨

**Resizing an activity:**
1. **Hover slowly** over the edge of an activity (left or right edge)
2. Wait for the cursor to change to resize arrows (↔)
3. **Click and drag** the edge to make it longer or shorter
4. **Release** when done

**Moving between rings:**
- You can also drag an activity **radially** (inward/outward) to move it to a different ring

**Tip**: This is much faster than opening forms and changing dates manually. Most users do all their planning adjustments with drag and drop!

## What's Next?

Now that you have the basics, explore these powerful features:

- **Zoom Controls**: Use the Zoom tab in the sidebar to focus on specific months or quarters (perfect for planning meetings!)
- **[Presentation Mode](08_PRESENTATION.md)** - Hide rings using checkboxes to create different views for different audiences
- **[Export](11_EXPORT.md)** - Download your wheel as PNG, PDF, SVG, or JPG for presentations
- **[Teams](09_TEAMS.md)** - Invite colleagues to collaborate on shared wheels
- **Inner Ring Text**: Click directly on the inner ring segments to add monthly goals or themes

**Pro tip**: To focus on a specific quarter, click the Zoom tab and use the Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4 buttons. This is what quarters are really for - quick navigation, not ring organization!
