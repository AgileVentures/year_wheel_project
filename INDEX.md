## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Which file should I read first?"
**Solution**: Start with PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, then follow the roadmap above

### Issue: "The documentation is overwhelming"
**Solution**: Focus on one file at a time. Start with SUPABASE_GUIDE.md and use others as reference

### Issue: "I don't understand the database schema"
**Solution**: Check DIAGRAMS.md for visual representation, then read ARCHITECTURE.md for details

### Issue: "I'm stuck on implementation"
**Solution**: 
1. Check SUPABASE_GUIDE.md for that specific step
2. Review CHECKLIST.md to ensure prerequisites are done
3. Search Supabase docs
4. Ask in Supabase Discord
