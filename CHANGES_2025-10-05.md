# Cleanup & Fixes - October 5, 2025

## Summary of Changes

This document tracks the cleanup and fixes performed on October 5, 2025.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Week Numbers ✅
**Problem**: Week 1 was appearing twice in the year wheel visualization.

**Root Cause**: The ISO week calculation was creating duplicate entries in the `seenWeeks` Set due to using a composite key (`${isoYear}-W${isoWeek}`) but weeks from different years could have the same week number.

**Solution**: Changed the uniqueness check to use just the week number instead of the composite key:
```javascript
// Before
const weekKey = `${isoYear}-W${isoWeek}`;
if (!seenWeeks.has(weekKey) && weeks.length < 53) {
  seenWeeks.add(weekKey);
  weeks.push(`W${isoWeek}`);
}

// After
if (!seenWeeks.has(isoWeek) && weeks.length < 53) {
  seenWeeks.add(isoWeek);
  weeks.push(isoWeek.toString());
}
```

**File**: `src/YearWheelClass.js` - `generateWeeks()` method

### 2. Week Number Prefix (Swedish Interface) ✅
**Problem**: Week numbers displayed with "W" prefix (e.g., "W1", "W2") but Swedish interface doesn't need the letter prefix.

**Solution**: Removed the "W" prefix, now displays just the number (e.g., "1", "2", "3").

**Change**: 
```javascript
// Before
weeks.push(`W${isoWeek}`);

// After
weeks.push(isoWeek.toString());
```

**File**: `src/YearWheelClass.js` - `generateWeeks()` method

### 3. Debug Code Removal ✅
**Problem**: Console.table() debug statement left in production code.

**Solution**: Removed the debug logging from the constructor.

**Change**:
```javascript
// Removed this line:
console.table(this.generateWeeks());
```

**File**: `src/YearWheelClass.js` - Constructor

## Files Archived

The following unused files were moved to the `archive/` folder:

### 1. YearWheelClassRedefined.js
- **Status**: Not imported or used anywhere
- **Description**: Incomplete refactoring attempt with cleaner, more concise code
- **Reason for archiving**: Development continued on `YearWheelClass.js` instead

### 2. year-wheel-refactored.js
- **Status**: Not imported or used anywhere
- **Description**: Legacy functional implementation (pre-React class version)
- **Reason for archiving**: Superseded by `YearWheelClass.js`

### 3. year-wheel.js
- **Status**: Not imported or used anywhere
- **Description**: Original vanilla JavaScript from kirkby's year-wheel project
- **Reason for archiving**: Superseded by React class-based implementation

## Archive Structure

```
archive/
├── README.md (documentation of archived files)
├── YearWheelClassRedefined.js
├── year-wheel-refactored.js
└── year-wheel.js
```

## Active Files

After cleanup, the active implementation consists of:

```
src/
├── YearWheelClass.js (Main implementation - ACTIVE)
├── YearWheel.jsx (React wrapper component)
├── App.jsx
└── (other React components)
```

## Testing

- ✅ Development server starts without errors
- ✅ No ESLint errors
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Week numbers now display correctly without duplicates
- ✅ Swedish interface (no "W" prefix)

## Commands Used

```bash
# Create archive folder
mkdir archive

# Move unused files
mv src/YearWheelClassRedefined.js archive/
mv src/year-wheel-refactored.js archive/
mv src/year-wheel.js archive/

# Test the application
yarn dev
```

## Verification Steps

1. Start the development server: `yarn dev`
2. Open the application in browser
3. Verify week numbers display as "1", "2", "3" etc. (not "W1", "W2", "W3")
4. Verify no duplicate week numbers appear
5. Check browser console for any errors (should be clean)

## Next Steps

Still to be completed from CLEANUP.md:

1. ⬜ Clean up commented code throughout the codebase
2. ⬜ Fix ESLint warnings (remove `/* eslint-disable no-unused-vars */`)
3. ⬜ Extract utility functions:
   - Date helpers (ISO week calculations)
   - Canvas helpers (drawing functions)
   - Color helpers (color manipulation)

## Documentation Updated

- ✅ CLEANUP.md - Updated with completion status
- ✅ archive/README.md - Created to document archived files
- ✅ CHANGES_2025-10-05.md - This file

## Impact Assessment

**Breaking Changes**: None
**User-Visible Changes**: 
- Week numbers now show without "W" prefix (Swedish style)
- No more duplicate week 1

**Performance Impact**: Minimal improvement (removed debug logging)
**Code Cleanliness**: Significant improvement (3 unused files archived)
