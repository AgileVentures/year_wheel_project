# SQL Migrations Status - Quick Reference

## The Good News üéâ

**The error you saw is GOOD!** It means realtime is **already enabled**.

```
ERROR: relation "year_wheels" is already member of publication "supabase_realtime"
```
‚Üë This means the table is already broadcasting realtime updates!

## What You Need to Do

### 1. ‚úÖ Verify Realtime (Already Working)

**Run this query** in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy and run from VERIFY_REALTIME.sql
SELECT tablename 
FROM pg_publication_tables
WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime'
  AND schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Expected result**: You should see these 5 tables:
- ‚úÖ `activity_groups`
- ‚úÖ `items`
- ‚úÖ `labels`
- ‚úÖ `wheel_rings`
- ‚úÖ `year_wheels`

If you see all 5 ‚Üí **Realtime is working!** Skip to step 2.

### 2. ‚ùó Apply RLS Policies (CRITICAL)

You still need to run **`FIX_TEAM_WHEEL_UPDATE.sql`** for team members to save changes.

**Why**: Team members can view shared wheels but get errors when saving.

**How**: 
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy entire contents of `FIX_TEAM_WHEEL_UPDATE.sql`
3. Run it
4. Verify with test query at bottom

**This adds**:
- UPDATE policy (team members can save)
- SELECT policy (team members can view)
- INSERT policy (team members can create items)
- DELETE policy (owners can delete wheels)

## Summary

| Migration | Status | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **ENABLE_REALTIME.sql** | ‚úÖ Already applied | Run VERIFY_REALTIME.sql to confirm |
| **FIX_TEAM_WHEEL_UPDATE.sql** | ‚ùì Unknown | **Run this now** (fixes save errors) |

## Quick Test After Running FIX_TEAM_WHEEL_UPDATE.sql

```sql
-- Check policies exist
SELECT policyname, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'year_wheels';
```

You should see 4 policies:
- ‚úÖ SELECT: "Users can view their wheels and team wheels"
- ‚úÖ UPDATE: "Users can update their wheels and team wheels"
- ‚úÖ INSERT: "Users can create wheels"
- ‚úÖ DELETE: "Owners can delete their wheels"

## Next Steps

1. **Run VERIFY_REALTIME.sql** ‚Üí Confirm all 5 tables
2. **Run FIX_TEAM_WHEEL_UPDATE.sql** ‚Üí Fix team member saves
3. **Test with team member** ‚Üí Have them edit and save a shared wheel
4. **Test with 2 browsers** ‚Üí Verify realtime sync + no save loop

## Files Created

- ‚úÖ `VERIFY_REALTIME.sql` - New file to check realtime status
- ‚úÖ `ENABLE_REALTIME.sql` - Updated with better error handling
- ‚úÖ `FIX_TEAM_WHEEL_UPDATE.sql` - Already exists, needs to be run
- ‚úÖ `SAVE_LOOP_FIX.md` - Documents the concurrent user fix
- ‚úÖ `SAVE_LOOP_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference

## The Bottom Line

**Realtime**: ‚úÖ Already working (that's why you got the error)  
**Save permissions**: ‚ùó Need to run FIX_TEAM_WHEEL_UPDATE.sql  
**Save loop**: ‚úÖ Fixed in React code (no SQL needed)

**Action required**: Just run `FIX_TEAM_WHEEL_UPDATE.sql` and you're done! üöÄ
