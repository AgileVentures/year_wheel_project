- **Can hide**: Uncheck ring visibility to hide all calendar activities
- **Can delete**: Removes from YearWheel only, not Google Calendar

**üì∏ Screenshot: Edit modal for synced activity showing disabled fields**

### Sync updates:

When calendar event changes in Google:

---

## Setting Up Google Sheets Sync

### Step 1: Connect Google Account

(Same as Google Calendar - Step 1 above)

If already connected for Calendar, skip to Step 2.

---

### Step 2: Select Spreadsheet and Sheet

**üì∏ Screenshot: Spreadsheet selection interface**

   - Or paste Google Sheets URL
   - Search by name if many sheets

5. **Select specific sheet** (tab within spreadsheet):
   - "2026 Campaign Calendar"
   - "Q1 Projects"
   - Etc.

---

### Step 3: Map Columns to Fields

**üì∏ Screenshot: Column mapping interface showing spreadsheet preview**

**The magic happens here:** YearWheel needs to know which spreadsheet columns map to activity fields.

**Example spreadsheet:**
| Campaign Name | Start Date | End Date | Team | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Spring Launch | 2026-01-15 | 2026-03-31 | Marketing | Planned |
| Summer Sale | 2026-06-01 | 2026-08-31 | Sales | Confirmed |

**Mapping configuration:**

1. **Activity Name Field**:
   - Select column: "Campaign Name"
   - This becomes the activity title on the wheel

2. **Start Date Field**:
   - Select column: "Start Date"
   - Date format: Auto-detected (YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, etc.)
   - If wrong format detected, manually specify

3. **End Date Field**:
   - Select column: "End Date"
   - Can be same as start date for single-day events

4. **Activity Group Field** (Optional):
   - Select column: "Team" or "Status"
   - YearWheel creates/maps groups based on unique values:
     - "Marketing" ‚Üí Marketing group (auto-color)
     - "Sales" ‚Üí Sales group (auto-color)

5. **Description Field** (Optional):
   - Select column: "Status" or any text column
   - Populates activity description

**üì∏ Screenshot: Completed column mapping with preview**

---

### Step 4: Configure Sync Options

**üì∏ Screenshot: Sync options panel**

**Options:**

1. **Row filters**:
   - Only sync rows where Status = "Confirmed"
   - Skip rows with empty dates
   - Only rows 2-50 (ignore header row 1)

2. **Sync frequency**:
   - Manual only
   - Daily at specific time
   - Hourly (not recommended for Sheets, too frequent)

3. **Conflict handling**:
   - **Replace all**: Delete existing activities, import fresh from Sheets
   - **Update existing**: Keep manual activities, update synced ones only
   - **Add new only**: Never delete, only add new rows

4. **Data validation**:
   - Require both start and end dates (skip incomplete rows)
   - Require activity name (skip blank names)
   - Date range validation (only 2026, ignore others)

---

### Step 5: Perform Initial Sync

1. **Click**: **"Preview Import"** to see what will be created
   - Shows table of pending activities
   - Highlights any errors (invalid dates, missing required fields)

**üì∏ Screenshot: Import preview table**

2. **Review**: Check that mapping is correct
3. **Click**: **"Import to Wheel"** button
4. **Wait**: Progress bar
5. **Success**: "Imported 15 activities from Google Sheets"

**üì∏ Screenshot: Wheel showing imported Sheets activities**

### Success indicators:
‚úÖ Activities from spreadsheet appear on wheel  
‚úÖ Dates, names, colors match spreadsheet data  
‚úÖ Source indicator shows "Google Sheets"  
‚úÖ No error activities (red flags)

---

## Managing Synced Sheets Data

### When spreadsheet updates:

**User updates Sheets:**
1. Changes row: "Spring Launch" ‚Üí "Spring Mega Launch"
2. Changes date: Start date 01/15 ‚Üí 01/20
3. Saves spreadsheet

**YearWheel sync (next scheduled or manual):**
1. Detects changed row via external ID
2. Updates activity name and date automatically
3. Shows "Last synced: 2 minutes ago" indicator

**üì∏ Screenshot: Sync status indicator showing recent update**

### Disconnecting Sheets sync:

1. **Ring settings** ‚Üí **"Manage Integration"**
2. **Click**: **"Disconnect Google Sheets"**
3. **Choose**: 
   - Keep existing activities (orphan them, become manual)
   - Delete all synced activities (clean slate)

---

## Advanced: Combining Calendar + Sheets

**Powerful workflow:**

**Scenario: Marketing team**
- **Google Calendar**: Team meetings, campaign milestones (Ring: "Key Events")
- **Google Sheets**: Detailed campaign activities (Ring: "Campaigns")
- **Manual activities**: Ad-hoc tasks, internal notes (Ring: "Internal Work")

**Result**: Complete picture with minimal manual entry!

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to connect Google account"

**Causes:**
- Pop-up blocker preventing OAuth window
- Cookie/privacy settings blocking Google auth
- Temporary Google API issue

**Solutions:**
1. Allow pop-ups for yearwheel.com
2. Try incognito/private window
3. Check Google account status (not suspended)
4. Wait 5 minutes and retry

---

### Issue: "No calendars found"

**Causes:**

### Issue: "Events not appearing on wheel"

**Causes:**
- Events outside date range (not in 2026 if wheel is 2026)
- Filter excludes events (keyword filter)
- Event is cancelled in Google Calendar
- Sync hasn't run yet

**Solutions:**
1. Check event dates in Google Calendar
2. Review sync filters in ring settings
3. Manually trigger sync: "Sync Now" button
4. Check sync logs for errors

### Issue: "Duplicate activities after sync"

**Causes:**
- Synced twice manually without using update mode
- External ID lost (rare database issue)

**Solutions:**
1. Delete duplicates manually
2. Disconnect and reconnect sync (orphan existing activities first)
3. Use "Replace all" mode to clean slate

---

### Issue: "Spreadsheet columns not mapping correctly"

**Causes:**
- Column headers changed in Sheets
- Wrong date format in Sheets
- Formula cells (not raw data)

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure column headers haven't changed
2. Standardize date format in Sheets (YYYY-MM-DD recommended)
3. Convert formula cells to values in Sheets
4. Re-do column mapping in YearWheel

## Best Practices

### Do's:

‚úÖ **Use dedicated calendars**: Create "YearWheel Sync" calendar in Google, share with team  
‚úÖ **Standardize naming**: Consistent event names make filtering easier  
‚úÖ **Test with small dataset**: Sync 5-10 events first, verify before syncing hundreds  
‚úÖ **Document mapping**: Note which columns map to which fields (for team reference)  
‚úÖ **Set appropriate sync frequency**: Daily for most cases, hourly only if critical

### Don'ts:

‚ùå **Don't sync personal calendar with sensitive events**: Work calendar only  
‚ùå **Don't sync too many calendars to one ring**: Creates clutter  
‚ùå **Don't rely on instant sync**: Allow 1-2 minutes for updates to propagate  
‚ùå **Don't edit dates in YearWheel for synced activities**: Edit in Google, sync will update

---

## Pro Tips

üí° **Color coding**: Use Google Calendar colors to auto-assign activity groups  
üí° **Naming convention**: Prefix calendar events with [CLIENT] or [PROJECT] for easy filtering  
üí° **Backup before sync**: Export wheel as .yrw before first big sync  
üí° **Separate rings**: One ring for calendar sync, one for Sheets, keeps it organized  
üí° **Recurring events**: YearWheel syncs each instance as separate activity

---

## Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

*Coming features (check latest version):*
- üîÑ **Bi-directional sync**: Changes in YearWheel push back to Google
- üìß **Gmail integration**: Create activities from email threads

**Q: What happens if I delete synced activity in YearWheel?**  
A: Removed from wheel only. Next sync will re-import it unless you filter it out.

**Q: Can I sync from Microsoft Outlook?**  
A: Not natively. Export Outlook to Google Calendar, then sync from there.

**Q: Is there a limit to activities synced?**  
A: Premium allows unlimited. Recommend <200 activities per ring for performance.

**Q: Can team members sync their own calendars to shared wheel?**
