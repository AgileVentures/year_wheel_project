- **Quality:** High-resolution (minimum 1200px width for main screenshots)
- **File size:** Optimize images to keep under 500KB each
- **Annotation:** Consider adding arrows or highlights to draw attention to key features
- **Branding:** Ensure screenshots show current YearWheel branding and colors

## Optimization

Before adding images, optimize them using:
- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) for PNG compression
- [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) for advanced optimization

## Fallback

If screenshots are not yet available, the guide will still display with text content only. The image elements are designed to degrade gracefully.

## Testing

After adding images, test the guide at:
- **Local:** http://localhost:5173/monday/how-to
- **Production:** https://yearwheel.se/monday/how-to

Also test iframe embedding at: https://iframetester.com/

- Images should show realistic but anonymized data (no real customer information)
- Consider creating video walkthroughs to complement static images
- Update this README if new images are added to the guide
