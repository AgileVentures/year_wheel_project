# Year Wheel POC

## Brand Colors

YearWheel uses a carefully crafted color palette that evokes trust, clarity, and the natural flow of time through the year.

### Text Colors

| Element | Color Name | HEX | RGB | Usage |
|---------|-----------|-----|-----|-------|
| "YEAR" | Teal/Cyan | `#00A4A6` | (0, 164, 166) | Primary brand color, CTAs, accents |
| "WHEEL" | Deep Blue/Indigo | `#1E1EBE` | (30, 30, 190) | Secondary text, headers |

### Wheel Icon Colors

The circular "wheel" symbol uses a gradient palette representing balance, clarity, and seasonal flow:

| Segment | Color Description | HEX | RGB | Usage |
|---------|------------------|-----|-----|-------|
| A | Deep navy blue | `#1B2A63` | (27, 42, 99) | Backgrounds, dark overlays |
| B | Royal blue | `#2D4EC8` | (45, 78, 200) | Active elements, interactive states |
| C | Teal green | `#2E9E97` | (46, 158, 151) | Hover states, secondary CTAs |
| D | Turquoise | `#36C2C6` | (54, 194, 198) | Accent highlights, badges |
| E | Light aqua | `#A4E6E0` | (164, 230, 224) | Subtle text, borders, backgrounds |
| F | Lime green | `#9FCB3E` | (159, 203, 62) | Success states, growth indicators |
| G | Deep forest green | `#336B3E` | (51, 107, 62) | Alternative dark accent |
| H | White/neutral | `#FFFFFF` | (255, 255, 255) | Text on dark, card backgrounds |

### Color Philosophy

- **Blue-green tones** (trust, calm, clarity) form the foundation
- **Green-lime accents** (growth, renewal, vitality) add energy
- **Gradient transitions** from teal to deep blue reinforce the "wheel motion" concept
- **Natural + digital hues** balance structure with creativity, perfect for planning tools

### Implementation

Use these colors consistently across:
- Hero sections (navy + teal gradients)
- CTAs (teal primary, white secondary)
- Badges (turquoise with light aqua text)
- Interactive elements (royal blue for hover, teal for active)
- Text hierarchy (white on dark, light aqua for secondary text)

## Todo & Fatures
### Current To-Do List
1. Implement Chakra UI as the CSS framework.
2. ~~Clean up and modularize the code in `year-wheel.js`.~~
3. ~~Divide each month section into weeks.~~
4. Make yearly events editable. (removed for now)
5. Fix placement of the text on rings/inner sections
6. Upgrade the color picker to use complete color palettes that harmonize well.
7. Redefine/refactor the entire class - see `YearWheelRedefined.js` (it's a mess atm)
8. Use GH Project as a feature tracker if needed
