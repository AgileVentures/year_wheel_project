This is edited online!

## Overview
Year Wheel POC (Proof of Concept) is a straightforward planning tool designed to present activities and events in an easily understandable format. Developed using React with Vite as the foundation, it primarily expands upon a vanilla JavaScript solution available at [kirkby's year-wheel GitHub repository](https://github.com/kirkby/year-wheel).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine
- Yarn package manager

### Installation
1. Clone (or fork and clone) this repository.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies by running:
   ```
   yarn
   ```
4. Start the development server with:
   ```
   yarn dev
   ```

## Contributing
Contributions are warmly welcomed. If you have an idea for improving Year Wheel POC, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.

### Current To-Do List
1. Implement Chakra UI as the CSS framework.
2. Clean up and modularize the code in `year-wheel.js`.
3. Divide each month section into weeks.
4. Make yearly events editable.
5. Upgrade the color picker to use complete color palettes that harmonize well.
6. Enable displaying events over time with a `startDate` and `endDate` (similar to yearly events).
7. Allow a ring to display data as graphical elements (e.g., a ring visualizing a valueâ€”a use case could be the number of planned customer visits or meetings).

...and more.

## Todo

1. Multiple Rings with Different Categories
Feature: Allow users to create multiple rings, each representing a different category or theme (e.g., events, operations, award shows).
Customization: Users can assign different colors to each ring, as well as control the spacing and size of each ring.
2. Customizable Event Sections
Feature: Enable users to add events to different sections within each ring.
Customization: Users can adjust the number of sections per ring, the text orientation, and the font size for event descriptions.
3. Color Coding and Legends
Feature: Users can define a color code for different types of events or categories.
Customization: Include a legend that explains the meaning of each color, placed outside the wheel or integrated within the design.
4. Logos and Icons within Sections
Feature: Allow users to upload logos or icons and place them within specific sections of the rings.
Customization: Users can control the size, placement, and rotation of the logos/icons.
5. Radial Grids and Time Dividers
Feature: Implement radial grids or time dividers that break down each ring into smaller time segments (e.g., weeks or days).
Customization: Users can adjust the number of segments and their visual style.
6. Central Information Display
Feature: Centralize the title, year, and other key information in the middle of the wheel.
Customization: Users can choose the font style, size, and additional details like descriptions or summaries.
7. Text Wrapping and Layout Options
Feature: Provide advanced text layout options, such as wrapping text within sections or allowing multiline text.
Customization: Users can set line spacing, text alignment, and maximum character limits for each section.
8. Custom Backgrounds and Borders
Feature: Allow users to set custom backgrounds or borders for the entire wheel or individual rings.
Customization: Users can upload images, set gradient backgrounds, or select solid colors.
9. Export Options with High-Resolution Support
Feature: Offer multiple export options, including PNG, JPEG, SVG, and PDF, with high-resolution support for printing.
Customization: Users can choose to export with or without a background and select the DPI for printing.
10. Drag-and-Drop Interface
Feature: Implement a drag-and-drop interface to easily move and adjust event sections or categories within the wheel.
Customization: Users can reposition sections or entire rings with ease.
11. Interactive Wheel Features
Feature: Allow users to create interactive wheels where sections can be clicked to reveal more information (e.g., pop-ups or links).
Customization: Users can set the interaction type (e.g., click, hover) and the content that appears.
12. Time-Based Animation
Feature: Implement a time-based animation where the wheel rotates to show the progression of time, or to highlight specific events.
Customization: Users can set the speed of the animation and decide which rings should animate.
13. Annotation and Markup Tools
Feature: Provide tools for users to add annotations or markups directly on the wheel (e.g., arrows, highlights).
Customization: Users can choose from different annotation styles and colors.
