# Year Wheel POC

> **ðŸ“¢ Latest Update (Oct 5, 2025)**: Week number alignment fixed! Comprehensive Supabase integration docs created. Ready for multi-user implementation.

## Overview
Year Wheel POC (Proof of Concept) is a straightforward planning tool designed to present activities and events in an easily understandable format. Developed using React with Vite as the foundation, it primarily expands upon a vanilla JavaScript solution available at [kirkby's year-wheel GitHub repository](https://github.com/kirkby/year-wheel).

## Todo & Fatures
### Current To-Do List
1. Implement Chakra UI as the CSS framework.
2. ~~Clean up and modularize the code in `year-wheel.js`.~~
3. ~~Divide each month section into weeks.~~
4. Make yearly events editable. (removed for now)
5. Fix placement of the text on rings/inner sections
6. Upgrade the color picker to use complete color palettes that harmonize well.
7. Redefine/refactor the entire class - see `YearWheelRedefined.js` (it's a mess atm)
8. Use GH Project as a feature tracker if needed
