# Year Wheel POC README

## Overview
Year Wheel POC (Proof of Concept) is a straightforward planning tool designed to present activities and events in an easily understandable format. Developed using React with Vite as the foundation, it primarily expands upon a vanilla JavaScript solution available at [kirkby's year-wheel GitHub repository](https://github.com/kirkby/year-wheel).

## Getting Started

3. Install dependencies by running:
   ```
   yarn
   ```
4. Start the development server with:

## Contributing
Contributions are warmly welcomed. If you have an idea for improving Year Wheel POC, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.

### Current To-Do List
1. Implement Chakra UI as the CSS framework.
2. Clean up and modularize the code in `year-wheel.js`.
3. Divide each month section into weeks.
4. Make yearly events editable.
5. Upgrade the color picker to use complete color palettes that harmonize well.
6. Enable displaying events over time with a `startDate` and `endDate` (similar to yearly events).
7. Allow a ring to display data as graphical elements (e.g., a ring visualizing a valueâ€”a use case could be the number of planned customer visits or meetings).

...and more.
