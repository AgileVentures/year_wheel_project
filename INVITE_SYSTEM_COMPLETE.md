# Team Invitation System - Complete Implementation âœ…

## Date: October 8, 2025

## What We Built

A fully functional team invitation system that allows users to invite others to their teams via shareable links. The system handles:
- New user signups
- Existing user invitations  
- Auto-acceptance on signup
- Graceful handling of already-processed invitations

## Key Features

### 1. Shareable Invite Links
- Generate unique invite links with tokens
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Share via any channel (email, Slack, WhatsApp, etc.)
- No SMTP configuration required

### 2. Smart Routing with React Router
- `/invite/:token` - Public route for accepting invitations
- Stores token in sessionStorage before redirecting to auth
- Automatically redirects back after login/signup
- Defaults to **signup form** for new users (not login)

### 3. Invitation Acceptance Flow
- Validates invitation (email match, expiration, status)
- Checks if user is already a team member
- Shows success message even if already accepted
- Redirects to dashboard teams view

### 4. Auto-Accept Trigger (Ready to Deploy)
- Database trigger on auth.users table
- Automatically processes pending invitations on signup
- No manual acceptance needed for new users

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **src/App.jsx**
   - Added React Router with BrowserRouter
   - Created `getAuthRedirect()` to check for pending invite tokens
   - Routes: `/auth`, `/invite/:token`, `/dashboard`, `/wheel/:wheelId`

2. **src/components/InviteAcceptPage.jsx**
   - Handles invite acceptance with authentication check
   - Uses sessionStorage for cross-navigation token persistence
   - Checks for existing membership before inserting
   - Gracefully handles already-accepted invitations
   - Uses `useRef` to prevent double-processing

3. **src/components/auth/AuthPage.jsx**
   - Detects pending invite token in sessionStorage
   - Defaults to **signup form** (not login) for invited users
   - Improves UX for new team members

4. **src/components/teams/InviteMemberModal.jsx**
   - Shows shareable invite link after sending invitation
   - Copy-to-clipboard with visual feedback
   - Tips on how to share the link

### Database Schema

```sql
-- team_invitations table
id              uuid PRIMARY KEY
team_id         uuid REFERENCES teams
email           text NOT NULL
token           uuid UNIQUE
invited_by      uuid REFERENCES auth.users
status          text (pending/accepted/declined)
expires_at      timestamptz
created_at      timestamptz

-- Auto-accept trigger (in TEAM_INVITATION_AUTO_ACCEPT.sql)
handle_new_user_team_invitations() -- Processes invitations on signup
```

## User Flow

### Scenario 1: New User Invitation

1. **Team owner** creates invitation for `newuser@example.com`
2. **System** generates invite link: `https://app.com/invite/TOKEN`
3. **Owner** copies link and shares via any channel
4. **New user** clicks link â†’ Redirected to `/auth` with **signup form**
5. **New user** signs up with invited email
6. **System** redirects to `/invite/TOKEN`
7. **InviteAcceptPage** checks membership, adds to team, shows success
8. **Auto-redirect** to `/dashboard?view=teams` after 2 seconds
9. **User** sees their new team in the Teams tab

### Scenario 2: Existing User Invitation

1. **Team owner** creates invitation for `existinguser@example.com`
2. **System** generates invite link
3. **Existing user** clicks link while not logged in
4. **System** redirects to `/auth` with **login form** (no pending token initially)
   - Note: Could be enhanced to detect "new" vs "existing" email
5. **User** logs in
6. **System** redirects to `/invite/TOKEN`
7. **InviteAcceptPage** adds user to team, shows success
8. **Redirect** to `/dashboard?view=teams`

### Scenario 3: Already Accepted Invitation

1. **User** clicks invite link they already accepted
2. **System** detects user is already a team member
3. **Shows success message**: "Du har blivit tillagd till teamet [Team Name]"
4. **Redirects** to dashboard teams view
5. **No error** - graceful handling

## Testing Results

âœ… **Invite link generation** - Working  
âœ… **Token storage in sessionStorage** - Working  
âœ… **Redirect to /auth** - Working  
âœ… **Redirect back to /invite/:token after signup** - Working  
âœ… **Default to signup form for invited users** - Working  
âœ… **Invitation acceptance** - Working  
âœ… **Already-accepted invitation handling** - Working  
âœ… **Team membership display** - Working (as shown in screenshot)  

### Evidence
Screenshot shows:
- Team: "Freefoot - Marknadsteam"
- 2 members (owner + invited user)
- Invited user `a5917468-bc95-4886-9a72-e03f4715e044` successfully added
- Status shows as "Du" (You) and "Medlem" (Member)

## Known Issues & Future Enhancements

### Minor Issues
1. ~~Error message shown even when invite worked~~ - **FIXED**: Now checks for existing membership
2. ~~Login form shown instead of signup for new users~~ - **FIXED**: Defaults to signup when invite token present

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Email notifications** - Configure Supabase SMTP for automatic email invites
2. **Invitation expiration UI** - Show countdown or expiration date in modal
3. **Bulk invitations** - Allow inviting multiple emails at once
4. **Custom roles** - Allow specifying role (member/admin) in invitation
5. **Invitation analytics** - Track who accepted, when, etc.
6. **Team invitation page** - Dedicated page showing team info before accepting

## Deployment Checklist

### Already Deployed âœ…
- [x] React Router integration
- [x] InviteAcceptPage component
- [x] Token persistence via sessionStorage
- [x] Signup form default for invites
- [x] Already-accepted invitation handling
- [x] Team membership UI

### Pending Deployment ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Run `TEAM_INVITATION_AUTO_ACCEPT.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
  - Requires elevated permissions (service_role)
  - Creates trigger on auth.users table
  - Auto-processes invitations on signup

### Optional Configuration ðŸ”§
- [ ] Configure Supabase SMTP settings
- [ ] Create custom email templates
- [ ] Set invitation expiration policy (currently 7 days)

## Console Logs (For Debugging)

Expected logs during invite acceptance:

```
InviteAcceptPage useEffect - user: null token: [TOKEN] hasProcessed: false
User not logged in, storing token and redirecting to /auth
Stored token: [TOKEN]
Performing hard redirect to /auth

# After signup/login:
getAuthRedirect - pendingToken: [TOKEN]
Redirecting to invite page: /invite/[TOKEN]
InviteAcceptPage useEffect - user: {email: ...} token: [TOKEN] hasProcessed: false
User is logged in, processing invitation
Cleared pendingInviteToken from sessionStorage
User is already a member, skipping insert  # If already accepted
```

## Success Criteria - All Met! âœ…

- [x] Users can generate shareable invite links
- [x] Links work for both new and existing users
- [x] New users see signup form (not login)
- [x] Invitations are validated (email, expiration, status)
- [x] Users are added to teams successfully
- [x] Already-processed invitations don't show errors
- [x] Users are redirected to teams view after acceptance
- [x] Team membership is displayed correctly

## Conclusion

The team invitation system is **fully functional** and ready for production use. The only remaining optional task is deploying the auto-accept trigger for new user signups.

**Great work!** ðŸŽ‰ The system handles edge cases gracefully and provides a smooth user experience for team collaboration.
