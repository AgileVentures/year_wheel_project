# React Router Integration - Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Installed React Router
```bash
yarn add react-router-dom
```

### 2. Updated App.jsx
- Wrapped app in `<BrowserRouter>`
- Created protected route wrapper
- Set up the following routes:

```
/ → Redirects to /dashboard (if logged in) or /auth
/auth → Login/Signup page
/dashboard → Main dashboard (protected)
/wheel/:wheelId → Wheel editor (protected)
/invite/:token → Invitation acceptance page (public)
```

### 3. Updated Components
- `InviteAcceptPage.jsx` - Now uses React Router hooks
- `Dashboard.jsx` - Supports URL parameters (`?view=teams`)
- Created route wrappers for wheel editor and dashboard

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Invite Flow
1. **User creates invitation** → Gets shareable link
   ```
   https://yourapp.com/invite/abc-123-def-456
   ```

2. **Recipient clicks link**:
   - If **not logged in** → Redirected to `/auth` (login/signup)
   - After auth → Redirected back to `/invite/:token`
   - If **already logged in** → Automatically added to team

3. **Auto-accept**:
   - Checks invitation validity
   - Adds user to team
   - Shows success message
   - Redirects to `/dashboard?view=teams`

### Navigation
- Dashboard tabs now support URL params:
  - `/dashboard` → Wheels tab
  - `/dashboard?view=teams` → Teams tab
  - `/dashboard?view=invitations` → Invitations tab

- Wheel editing:
  - `/wheel/abc-123` → Opens specific wheel
  - Back button → Returns to `/dashboard`

## 📋 Testing the Routes

### Test 1: Direct URL Access
Open these URLs directly:
```
http://localhost:5173/dashboard
http://localhost:5173/dashboard?view=teams
http://localhost:5173/auth
http://localhost:5173/invite/[paste-token-here]
```

### Test 2: Invite Link Flow
1. Create team and invite someone
2. Copy the invite link from modal
3. Open in incognito/private window
4. Should redirect to login
5. After login → auto-added to team

### Test 3: Protected Routes
1. Log out
2. Try accessing `/dashboard` or `/wheel/xyz`
3. Should redirect to `/auth`

## 🔧 Configuration

### Vite Config (if needed)
If you get 404 errors on refresh, add to `vite.config.js`:
```javascript
export default {
  server: {
    historyApiFallback: true
  }
}
```

### Deployment (Vercel/Netlify)
Add a rewrite rule for SPA routing:

**vercel.json**:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

**netlify.toml**:
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. ✅ React Router installed and configured
2. ⏳ Deploy auto-accept trigger (`TEAM_INVITATION_AUTO_ACCEPT.sql`)
3. ⏳ Test complete invitation workflow
4. ⏳ Optional: Add URL state persistence for filters/searches

## 🎯 Routes Summary

| Route | Access | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | Public | Redirects to dashboard or auth |
| `/auth` | Public | Login/Signup page |
| `/dashboard` | Protected | Main dashboard with tabs |
| `/dashboard?view=teams` | Protected | Teams tab |
| `/dashboard?view=invitations` | Protected | Invitations tab |
| `/wheel/:wheelId` | Protected | Wheel editor |
| `/invite/:token` | Public | Accept team invitation |
