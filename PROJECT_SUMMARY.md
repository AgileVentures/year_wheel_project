# Year Wheel Project - Summary Report

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Project**: Year Wheel Visualization System  
**Status**: Ready for Supabase Integration

---

## Executive Summary

The Year Wheel project is a React-based visualization tool that creates interactive circular calendars. We've completed a comprehensive analysis and prepared the project for database integration and multi-user support with Supabase.

## Key Findings

### 1. Active Code Identification ‚úÖ

**Active File**: `YearWheelClass.js`
- Used by `YearWheel.jsx` component
- Contains all drawing and interaction logic
- Handles rotation, dragging, and export functionality

**Inactive File**: `YearWheelClassRedefined.js`
- Not imported anywhere
- Appears to be an incomplete refactoring attempt
- **Recommendation**: Archive or delete

### 2. Week Number Alignment - FIXED ‚úÖ

**Problem Identified**:
- Week numbers were simple counters (1, 2, 3...)
- Did not follow ISO 8601 standard
- Misaligned with calendar months

**Solution Implemented**:
- Replaced with proper ISO week number calculation
- Weeks now correctly span year boundaries
- Display format: "W1", "W2", etc.
- Aligns with international calendar standards

**Code Changed**: `YearWheelClass.js` ‚Üí `generateWeeks()` method

### 3. Current Architecture

```
Frontend (React + Vite)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Canvas-based visualization (HTML5 Canvas API)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Local storage for persistence
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Export to PNG/SVG/JPEG
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Interactive controls (zoom, rotate, drag)
```

**Tech Stack**:
- React 18.2
- Vite 5.0 (build tool)
- canvas2svg (SVG export)
- SASS (styling)

## Documentation Created

## Database Schema Overview

### Tables Designed

1. **year_wheels** - Main wheel metadata
   - Title, year, colors
   - User ownership
   - Public/private flags
   - Share tokens

2. **wheel_rings** - Ring configuration
   - Order and orientation
   - Links to parent wheel

3. **ring_data** - Actual content
   - Month-by-month data
   - Text arrays for each segment

4. **shared_wheels** - Sharing tracking
   - Who shared with whom
   - View analytics

### Security Features

- ‚úÖ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- ‚úÖ Users can only access their own data
- ‚úÖ Public wheels accessible via share token
- ‚úÖ Cascade deletes on user removal
- ‚úÖ Data validation constraints

## Recommended Implementation Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. Set up Supabase project
2. Run database migrations
3. Implement authentication
4. Create basic dashboard
5. Test CRUD operations

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-4)
1. Save/load wheels from database
2. Auto-save functionality
3. Dashboard with wheel listing
4. Delete and duplicate wheels
5. Loading states and error handling

### Phase 3: Sharing (Week 5)
1. Generate share links
2. Public view page
3. Copy/fork functionality
4. Privacy settings

### Phase 4: Polish (Week 6+)
1. Mobile responsive design
2. Templates and examples
3. Enhanced export options
4. Keyboard shortcuts
5. User onboarding

## UI/UX Improvements Suggested

### Current Pain Points
- ‚ùå No persistence across sessions
- ‚ùå Single wheel at a time
- ‚ùå No user accounts
- ‚ùå Manual save only
- ‚ùå No sharing capability

### Proposed Solutions
- ‚úÖ Supabase authentication
- ‚úÖ Dashboard with multiple wheels
- ‚úÖ Auto-save (3-5 second debounce)
- ‚úÖ Share via link or email
- ‚úÖ Templates for quick start
- ‚úÖ Responsive mobile design

## Cost Estimation

### Supabase Free Tier
- **Database**: 500MB
- **Storage**: 1GB
- **Bandwidth**: 2GB/month
- **Users**: 50,000 MAU
- **Cost**: $0/month

**Verdict**: Perfect for initial launch and testing

### Paid Tier (if needed)
- **Database**: 8GB
- **Storage**: 100GB
- **Bandwidth**: 250GB/month
- **Cost**: $25/month

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. ‚úÖ Review this summary and documentation
2. ‚úÖ Decide on authentication providers (Email, Google, GitHub?)
3. ‚úÖ Create Supabase project
4. ‚úÖ Archive/delete YearWheelClassRedefined.js
5. ‚úÖ Remove console.log from YearWheelClass.js

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Run database migrations in Supabase
2. Implement authentication layer
3. Create dashboard component
4. Build wheel CRUD operations
5. Add auto-save functionality

### Medium-term (Month 2)
1. Implement sharing features
2. Create templates
3. Mobile responsive design
4. User onboarding flow
5. Analytics integration

## Technical Decisions Needed

1. **Authentication Providers**
   - Email/Password? (Yes/No)
   - Google OAuth? (Yes/No)
   - GitHub OAuth? (Yes/No)
   - Other providers?

2. **User Limits**
   - Max wheels per user?
   - Max rings per wheel?
   - Storage limits?

3. **Pricing Model**
   - Free for all users?
   - Freemium (basic free, premium paid)?
   - Subscription model?

4. **Features Priority**
   - What's most important for v1.0?
   - What can wait for v1.1?

5. **Branding**
   - Custom domain for shared wheels?
   - White-label option?

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
- Supabase integration (well-documented)
- Authentication setup (built-in)
- Basic CRUD operations (straightforward)

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Data migration (if existing users)
- Performance with many wheels
- Mobile responsiveness

### High Risk ‚ùå
- None identified at this stage
